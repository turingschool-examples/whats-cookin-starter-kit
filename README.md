## Context:
Each member of our group has been in Turing for 3 months. (Mod2, week 3)

## Where you can find the spec:
https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/whats-cookin-part-one.html

## Contributors:

## Learning Goals:
1. Collaboration with others 
2. API fetching
3. Using array iterators in functions 
4. Creating a wire frame
5. Use TDD testing to build data model
6. WebPack 
7. Practice import and exports
8. Practice git work flow 
9. Practice a uniform project management system

## Technology Used:
VS Code
JavaScript
Mocha
Chai
Github
Terminal
WebPack
HTML
CSS
## Wins:
A consistent win would be overcoming the limitation of merge conflicts. Each member created their own test, their own class, and their own webpage section. Using daily standup's our group was able to communicate effectively and minimize possibilities of major merge conflicts. As a group, our second major win was the retrieval of our api data, once data became accessible outside of the fetch call our website gained practical functionality. 

## Challenges:
The greatest challenges were...

1. The ability to access api data after the promise was resolved 
2. The ability for functions to be on page load  
3. Group scheduling across time zones
4. Making sure commits seemed balanced 

## Future Features:
1. More user friendly interface
2. Featured recipe on window page load
3. Welcome user on home page
4. A page introducing our website for entry

 
## Possible additions:
1. More functionality to the search bar:  type partial words and filter possible recipes 
2. Additional filter options as part of the front page spec
