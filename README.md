# Learning Goals

Solidify and demonstrate our understanding of: 

* DRY Javascript, HTML & CSS

* `GET` and `POST` network requests

* Test driven development

* Accessibility features for different impairments

* Semantic HTML

* Modifying code based on feedback

## Technologies Used

* Node Package Manager (NPM)
* Virtual Studio Code
* Github
* Git
* Webpack

## Wins

Group - Achieving 100% on lighthouse accessibility audit

Zen McMillan - Understanding how webpack imports and exports work with other files and directories within a project scope.

Jack Alfonso - Interacting with APIs and adding accessibility features.

Dan Lavery - Becoming more familiar with writing tests and coordinating with larger numbers of interconnected files.

## Challenges

 Coordinating through schedule conflicts that came up suddenly

 Zen McMillan - Understanding `GET` network requests was very challenging. Reading MDN documentation helped me understand how to fetch data.
 
 Jack Alfonso - Understanding new file structures (webpack). I overcame this through a combination of trial and error and reading documentation

 Dan Lavery - Understanding how to move from using a local data model to fetch calls. Reaching out for help and collaboration allowed me to overcome this.
