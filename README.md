# What's Cookin'? 

## Group Project

## Overview

What's cookin' in your kitchen?  Need some fresh ideas? Look no further!  On page load, our application displays random recipes to cook that allows users to save and delete recipes to their own profile.  Users will even get their own randomized webpage title!

## Local Set Up Instructions

- From the repo click the code button and copy the SSH link.
- Open terminal by pressing command + space bar, and search for terminal
- Inside of you terminal type `git clone` and then paste the ssh link. It should look like this: [https://github.com/nairnairnair/whats-cookin](https://github.com/nairnairnair/whats-cookin)
- In your terminal type `cd whats-cookin`
- Run `NPM install` from your command line: npm install
- Do not run `npm audit fix --force`
- Then type `npm start`
- This will run the Webpack in the terminal so you can view and use the application in your browser
- The browser should then deploy using a local host
- Find the line that says Project is running at: http://localhost:8080/ Copy and paste that URL into your browser into your browser. Now the application set up and ready to use!
- NOTE: Make sure that you type `Control + C` in your terminal when you are done using the application. This ensure the server will stop running before your close your Terminal.

## Website instruction

- Upon opening the browser, a user may roam the application as they choose.
- A user can view a list of all recipes and click on either the recipe photo or recipe name to view more information that includes recipe ingredients, instructions, and total cost.
- If a user like a particular recipe, they can choose to save the recipe as well as delete it.

## Future Features & Goals

## Project management
- As a team, we first began working with logic in each class file and then moved onto working with the DOM in scripts.js
- We used a google sheet to manage our excalidarws, ideas, and templates for the project: (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HqyPQ5XYk4wWnOfB0n6NwZtEkEWUK25qzbUWfnrL12Q/edit)
- We used a [Github Project Board](https://github.com/users/nairnairnair/projects/3/views/1) to stay on task and meet the deadline.
- The project specs and guideline for Part One of this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/whats-cookin-part-one.html)
